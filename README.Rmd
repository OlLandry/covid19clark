A very limited `R` package (with no functions and just one vignette) that can be used to get daily updates of changes in the distribution of COVID-19 within a limited geographic extent centered on a city of interest, in this case Worcester, MA, the home of Clark University.  

The repo contains code to pulls daily data from the Johns Hopkins University [COVID-19 repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/), and adapts code from Rami Krispin's [`coronavirus`](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) package, which has a very nice interactive, global dashboard. 

This packages was made to highlight the regional change, and to try resolve some of the county level detail available in source datasets, to track finer spatial changes. 

**Last update**: `r lubridate::now()`
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/figures/case_maps.png")
```

## Notes

- **I am not an epidemiologist, so this information should not be taken as authoritative. There may be flaws in the code or data handling that lead to misleading results.**
- If the map is correct, it is nevertheless misleading in that the number of cases is almost certainly an underestimate, as US testing has been very limited. This statement should be uncontroversial. To support that claim, [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html) is the CDC's page on testing rates. [Here](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-per-capita-chart-us-behind-2020-3?op=1) is a comparison of the US testing rate relative to other countries. 
- The county-level map (top left) consists of incomplete records and sum to less than reported totals. It is unclear whether county level data are being or will continue to be reported through to the source. You will note that this map shows no cases for Connecticut, because the reported cases there are only given at the state level. 
- For Massachusetts, better county-level information is available in the summary reports from the Department of Public Health, found [here](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring). The totals seems to match the JHU source data, but the state reports most cases as presumptive, not confirmed, which is how they are described in the JHU data. 
- The state-level maps should provide the correct numbers.
